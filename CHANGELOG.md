Quilt Change Log
================

Up Next
-------------

- Package the OVS kernel module for the latest DigitalOcean image to speed up
- Renamed specs to blueprints.

Release 0.1.0
-------------

Release 0.1.0 most notably modifies `quilt run` to evaluate Quilt specs using
Node.js, rather than within a Javascript implementation written in Go. This
enables users to make use of many great Node features, such as package management,
versioning, unit testing, a rich ecosystem of modules, and `use
strict`. In order to facilitate this, we now require `node` version 7.10.0 or
greater as a dependency to `quilt run`.

What's new:

- Fix a bug where Amazon spot requests would get cancelled when there are
multiple Quilt daemons running in the same Amazon account.
- Improve the error message for misconfigured Amazon credentials.
- Fix a bug where inbound and outbound public traffic would get randomly
dropped.
- Support floating IP assignment in DigitalOcean.
- Support arbitrary GCE projects.
- Upgrade to OVS2.7.
- Fix a race condition where the minion boots before OVS is ready.
- Build the OVS kernel module at runtime if a pre-built version is not
available.
- Evaluate specs using Node.js.

Release 0.0.1

Release 0.0.1 is an experimental release targeted at students in the CS61B
class at UC Berkeley.

Release 0.0.0

We are proud to announce the initial release of [Quilt](http://quilt.io)!  This
release provides an alpha quality implementation which can deploy a whole [host
of distributed applications](http://github.com/quilt) to Amazon EC2, Google
Cloud Engine, or DigitalOcean.  We're excited to begin this journey with our
inaugural release!  Please try it out and [let us
know](http://quilt.io/#contact) what you think.
